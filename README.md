## 🔍 Key Analytical Questions Answered

- 📈 What is the total number of policies purchased?
- 🧑‍🌾 Which age group buys the most policies?
- 🌍 Which regions contribute most to total premium collections?
- 💸 How many customers have claimed insurance vs. those who haven’t?
- 🚩 Which policy types are most and least profitable?
- 📆 What are the trends in policy purchase over time?
- 🎯 How can we segment customers based on risk or value?

Each query is designed to simulate real-time reporting tasks for analysts working in the insurance domain.

## 🧠 Insights Generated

- Regional performance in terms of both volume and premium value.
- Claims ratio comparison between various demographics.
- Policy type preferences across different age and region groups.
- Customer segments with high premium but low claim rates.
- Trends useful for upselling or targeting renewal campaigns.
